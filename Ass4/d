You can increase the number of technical workshops and hackathons. Different organisations could be contacted to organise hackathons on different fields of learning. Like recently in august there was this AI hackathon, it was great fun and learning but we could not build much do to simultaneous classes. Having these in tyrst would be lot of fun and learn. You could arrange corresponding workshops in the four days and give some days of the following break for the hackathon. We have multitude of fields to start with. Let students get their hands dirty with machine learning, AI, cloud and what not.

I expect to be given the responsibility of technical work starting from the basic website design to handling various issues in portals (like issues in the rendevous portal). Currently I am also a member of Dev. Club and we people have much experience in this. I may also be handled responsibility of organizing technical workshops on various fields of learning.

Not much experience at organizing major events. But I have been executive in TnP IITD in which I gained exposure in how to organize tests, ppts and things like that. So I can handle any such responsibility given to me.
