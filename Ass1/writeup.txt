ASSIGNMENT 1(A): FABRIC BREAKUP
Used the concept of stacks. Maintains a main stack of clothes called 'pile' in which all the values of clothes are stored as in a stack.
Another array (stack) is maintained in which the maximum value's index is stored at top, then the index of next maximum value BELOW that cloth
is stored and so on. Corresponding to each value is stored the number of cloth above it. Hence it takes O(1) time to pop the most favourite cloth.
Adding cloth also takes O(1) time as we just compare it with the highest maximum.

ASSIGNMENT 1(B): GROWABLE DEQUEUES
The growable deque is implemented using arrays by assuming two indices low and high which are the first and last elements of the deque. If low becomes 
zero we double the array and copy current contents into latter half of the new array while if high becomes sizeof(Array) - 1 we double size of array and
copy the current contents into the former half of the array.
